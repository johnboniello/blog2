#Learning to Code  

For the past 4 or so weeks I've been learning to code. This actually started sometime ago, about 6 or so years, and I stopped when I wasn't really learning anything.  They always say to have a project in mind when learning, which I did not at the time.  

So, back then, when I was teaching in the Bronx, I decided to try to learn Python.  As I said, I was unsuccessful.  I learned the basics, but couldn't do much with it.  This time was different.  I was in my office one day and my colleague Ann asked me if there was a way to use excel to calculate the time a student uses on tests and whether or not he/she actually needs an extended time accommodation.  I solved that problem quickly, but then the task took on a different layer.  Could I make this into an app? I decided to investigate and attempt to make this an application using Python.  This set me on a path to learning not only Python, but also how to use Qt for the Graphical User Interface (GUI), how to write html and css for the website I wanted so that people could download it, how to package applications for installation in windows.  

I am by no means an expert in any of these things, I used a lot of tutorials and walkthroughs.  I also yelled a lot and felt like I was stuck more times than I felt like I was successful. But that feeling of success, when the program or the website do what you want it to. Man, its like a drug.  

So here I am, about 4 weeks in. I have a program with a GUI that can be installed in Windows (working on the mac solution but need a better mac or figure out how to do it on linux), a functioning website with the program there and a place to write, as well as a place to keep my research roundups. 
Its been a pretty good 4 weeks.  

My next task: learn Django with Python to develop this calculator into a webapp and to develop my next project, which has really good potential to help a lot of schools with their PBIS systems, and someday in the future, expand inot RtI to make it a true MTSS system.  

First, I'm gonna spend some time with my daughter.
